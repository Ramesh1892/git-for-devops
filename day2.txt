# 📅 Git Day 2 – File Tracking, Status, and Logs
# 👨‍💻 By: Ramesh Vutukuri

# ----------------------------------------
# ✅ Create multiple files
echo "DevOps" > dev.txt
echo "Cloud" > cloud.txt

# ✅ Track file changes
git add dev.txt
git commit -m "Added dev.txt"
git status

# ✅ Remove a file from Git (but keep locally)
git rm --cached cloud.txt

# ✅ View commit history
git log --oneline
git show <commit-id>

# ✅ Check difference
git diff             # Between working dir and staging
git diff --cached    # Between staging and last commit

# 🧠 Concepts:
# - `git rm --cached`: Untracks a file but keeps it
# - `git diff`: Shows what's changed before committing
# - `git show`: Shows details of a commit
